# TBD

# TODO

- Use TS for server; JavaScript for UI
- Server should be Apollo GraphQL with Fastify integration. Set everything up without Fastify and then switch
- Gather info about P1 and P2 from SDS011 and show it in the UI
- Setup infra using Ansible
- Consider UI to be React Native
- Move schema to gql/graphql file
- once the graphql server is deployed, rename the stats collection in mongo to BME280
